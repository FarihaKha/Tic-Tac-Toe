# Tic-Tac-Toe
### Play a fun game of Tic-Tac-Toe against AI! Are you smarter than a computer?
This is a simple one-player Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against a computer opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm, making it nearly impossible to win!

## Description
This project implements a one-player Tic-Tac-Toe game, where the player faces off against a computer using the Minimax algorithm. The AI will always play optimally, making it extremely difficult to beat. The game features a 3x3 grid and standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules.

## Features
- Single-Player Mode: Play against an AI powered by the Minimax algorithm.
- Minimax AI: The AI evaluates all possible moves and chooses the best one, ensuring it never loses.
- Game Reset: After each game, you can restart and challenge the AI again.
- Simple UI: A clean and straightforward interface for an enjoyable gaming experience.

### Uses Java

## How to Play
1. Run the game and wait for the prompt.
2. Youâ€™ll be asked to place your move (either 'X' or 'O') on the board by selecting an empty cell.
3. After your move, the computer will automatically make its move using the Minimax algorithm.
4. The game continues until there is a winner or a tie.

## Minimax Algorithm
The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used to optimize the AI's moves. It evaluates all possible outcomes of the game and picks the move that maximizes the computer's chance of winning while minimizing the player's chances. This makes the AI unbeatable, ensuring that even if you play perfectly through defense, the game will end in a tie.
